We'll do both kinds of normlaization. You are told by an expert (and you can also get an idea of why by doing a historam of features) that the M1 and Q feature aare best treated as having normal distrbutions and feature DD is coming from a fixed range. So, we'll apply standard scaling to M1 and Q and min-max scaling to DD:"],"metadata":{"id":"kTQCVJ5iKWJL"}},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"KlGW56QsazkU"},"source":["import sklearn.preprocessing"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"cKz6XAZtb5_0"},"source":["x_m1 = df[['m1']].values\n","m1_scaler = sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler()\n","x_m1_scaled = m1_scaler.fit_transform(x_m1)\n","df[\"m1\"] = x_m1_scaled\n","\n","display(df[\"m1\"])"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"4tWyMtXW8leU"},"source":["display(x_m1_scaled.mean(), x_m1_scaled.std())"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"dLhdTDjWdVd8"},"source":["x_q = df[['q']].values\n","q_scaler = sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler()\n","x_q_scaled = q_scaler.fit_transform(x_q)\n","df[\"q\"] = x_q_scaled"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"24s27A_Jddsl"},"source":["x_dd = df[['dd']].values\n","dd_scaler = sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler()\n","x_dd_scaled = dd_scaler.fit_transform(x_dd)\n","\n","df[\"dd\"] = (2 * x_dd_scaled) - 1"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"b5HN95mJdgFQ"},"source":["display(df)"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"_unT3i7q9FZ5"},"source":["display(df['dd'].min(), df['dd'].max())"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"OJ_t0DKMTn3x"},"source":["## Feature transformations"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["You are also told by an expert tat age number may not be directly important, but rather, age groups of less than 25 years old, between 25 and 40 and above 40 years old run different risk levels.
