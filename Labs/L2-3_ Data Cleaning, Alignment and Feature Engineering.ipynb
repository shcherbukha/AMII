The final goal is to see if they have a certain disease or not. Measurements taken from patients in the two clincs are presented in dataframes `df_c1` and `df_c2`. We also have an inspection log, recorded in `df_m`, for the devices used in \"clinic1\" and \"clinic2\" where a number of variables from the the device are measured. Two of these variables, **R1** and **R3**, are believed to affect the readings taken from the patients (the other tow readings are not relevant). The `df_c1` and `df_c2` datasets are labeled with an actual diagnosis whether the patient had the disease or not and the goal is to predict the existence of disease based on the measurements taken from the patients.
